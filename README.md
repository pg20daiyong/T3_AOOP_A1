Notes
Call your project anything you want - and submit a zip file with the following filename:
"PG##YourName_AOOP_a1.zip"

If you project is greater than 20MB, delete .vs and Obj folders before zipping it.
Back up your work! Whenever you work on your project, copy the entire project folder to your flash drive AND the network drive. Copying it to Dropbox or Google Drive isnâ€™t a bad idea either
